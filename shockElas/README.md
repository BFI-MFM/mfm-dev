# Shock Elasticities

Both shock exposure and price elasticities can be computed, along with many auxiliary measures such as the stationary density and term structures, through the toolbox deveoped by Yiran Fan and Paymon Khorrami. As a demo, you can run

```matlab
demo_BS2014_SEimfd1
```

It uses the model by Brunnermeier & Sannikov (2014) as an example and computes the shock elasticities and other auxiliary outputs (stationary density, etc.)

The toolbox is versatile and contains many useful functions. For more information, look at the [PDF guide](/shockElas/main.pdf).
